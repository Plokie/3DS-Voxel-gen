# 3DS-Voxel-gen
A test project of a 3DS voxel terrain generation homebrew project

I'm uploading this project because I haven't been able to finish it recently in light of exams and preparing for Uni. I hope that something here can help people make their own stuff, or maybe contribute to make this project more functional!
# Building
Ensure DevKitPro and GCC is installed and set up as a path variable in the OS. Open CMD in the root folder and run 'make'. Project should build. 
If there are any issues please let me know in Issues, I haven't had the time or resources to test building from scratch myself.
